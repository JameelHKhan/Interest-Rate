# Interest-Rate

Week 2 assignments from Intro to Python at JHU

Skills: string input/output, data types, operators, and expressions.

Part 1 (interest.py): The program takes in input, computes, and prints the compound interest on a mortgage loan.

Part 2 (rate.py): The program uses a modified version of the interest formula and calculates the interest rate given the total amount paid, the principle, the term, and the number of interest payments.

One of the learning objectives for the two programs is to show students the limitations of the float data point and how it's converted into machine language.
